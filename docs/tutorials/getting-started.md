# Tractus-SDK Documentation

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with the Tractus-X SDK, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.12+** installed on your system
- **Internet connection** for downloading packages
- **Basic Python knowledge** (variables, functions, imports)
- **Text editor** or IDE for writing code

## Installation Guide

### Development Environment Setup

We recommend using a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python projects:

```bash title="Create Virtual Environment"
# Create a new virtual environment
python -m venv tractux-sdk-env

# Activate the environment
# On Windows:
tractux-sdk-env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source tractux-sdk-env/bin/activate
```

The Tractus-X SDK can be installed in two ways: from PyPI (recommended for most users) or from source (for developers).

=== "Install from PyPI (Recommended)"

    This is the easiest way to get started:

    ```bash
    # Install the SDK directly from PyPI (recommended for users)
    pip install tractusx-sdk
    
    # Verify the installation works
    python -c "
    try:
        from tractusx_sdk.dataspace.services import BaseConnectorService
        print('‚úÖ SDK Ready!')
        print('BaseConnectorService imported successfully')
    except Exception as e:
        print('‚ùå Import failed:')
        print(f'Error: {e}')
        import traceback
        traceback.print_exc()
    "
    ```

=== "Install from Source"

    If you need the latest development version or want to contribute:

    ```bash
    # Only use this if you need the latest development version
    git clone https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/tractusx-sdk.git
    cd tractusx-sdk
    pip install -e .
    
    # Verify installation
    python -c "
    try:
        from tractusx_sdk.dataspace.services import BaseConnectorService
        print('‚úÖ SDK Ready!')
        print('BaseConnectorService imported successfully')
    except Exception as e:
        print('‚ùå Import failed:')
        print(f'Error: {e}')
        import traceback
        traceback.print_exc()
    "
    ```

!!! success "Installation Complete!"
    If you see "‚úÖ SDK Ready!" then you're all set to continue to the next step!

!!! warning "Compatibility Notice"
    Currently this SDK is not 100% compatible and has not been tested against the `v0.11.x` connector. The issue is being worked on [here](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/tractusx-sdk/issues/159).


### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, here are common solutions:

??? question "Import Errors"
    
    **Problem**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tractusx_sdk'`
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Ensure you activated your virtual environment
    - Reinstall the SDK: `pip uninstall tractusx-sdk && pip install tractusx-sdk`
    - Check Python version: `python --version` (should be 3.12+)

??? question "Connection Errors"
    
    **Problem**: Cannot connect to connector
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Verify you have valid connector credentials
    - Check network connectivity
    - Contact your dataspace administrator for correct configuration

### Next Steps

Now that you have the SDK installed verify it: [Create your First Asset](./create-first-asset.md)

Once you have the SDK installed and verified check the following links:

1. **üìö Explore Libraries**: Learn about the [Dataspace Library](../api-reference/dataspace-library/index.md) for connector services
2. **üîç Read Services Documentation**: Check out [connector services](../api-reference/dataspace-library/connector/services.md) for detailed API reference
3. **üìñ SDK Structure**: Understand the [SDK architecture](../core-concepts/sdk-architecture/sdk-structure-and-components.md)
4. **ü§ù Join Community**: Connect with other developers in our [discussions](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/tractusx-sdk/discussions)
