### Asset Model

The Asset Model represents the metadata and configuration required to define an asset in the Eclipse Dataspace Connector (EDC). Assets are the core entities exchanged or managed in a dataspace, and they include details such as identifiers, data addresses, and associated properties

```python
from tractusx_sdk.dataspace.models.connector.model_factory import ModelFactory

asset = ModelFactory.get_asset_model(
    dataspace_version=dataspace_version,
    oid=oid,
    data_address=data_address,
    context=context,
    properties=properties,
    private_properties=private_properties
)
```

#### Explanation of Parameters

- `dataspace_version`: Specifies the version of the dataspace being used. Ensures compatibility with the EDC.
- `oid`: The unique identifier for the asset being defined. This is used to distinguish the asset in the dataspace.
- `data_address`: A dictionary that specifies the location or type of the data associated with the asset.
- `context`: Defines the namespace for interpreting metadata and policies.
- `properties`: A dictionary of metadata associated with the asset. These are general properties that describe the asset.
- `private_properties`: A dictionary of sensitive or restricted metadata associated with the asset. These properties are not publicly accessible.

### Catalog Model

The Catalog Model represents the metadata and configuration required to query and retrieve available assets from a counterparty in the Eclipse Dataspace Connector (EDC). It is used to interact with the catalog endpoint of a counterparty to discover assets that can be negotiated or exchanged.

```python
from tractusx_sdk.dataspace.models.connector.model_factory import ModelFactory

catalog_model = ModelFactory.get_catalog_model(
    dataspace_version=dataspace_version,
    counter_party_address=counter_party_address,
    counter_party_id=counter_party_id
)
```

#### Explanation of Parameters

The Contract Negotiation Model represents the metadata and configuration required to initiate and manage contract negotiations in the Eclipse Dataspace Connector (EDC). Contract negotiations are a key step in establishing agreements between parties for data exchange, ensuring that both access and usage policies are agreed upon before the transfer of data.

```python
from tractusx_sdk.dataspace.models.connector.model_factory import ModelFactory

contract_negotiation_model = ModelFactory.get_contract_negotiation_model(
