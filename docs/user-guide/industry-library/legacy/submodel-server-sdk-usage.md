# Industry Submodel Service Usage

## Adapters

### FileSystemAdapter

The FileSystemAdapter is a utility provided by the Tractus-X SDK to interact with the file system for managing submodels. It allows users to perform common file operations such as reading, writing, deleting files, and managing directories.

```python
from tractusx_sdk.industry.adapters.submodel_adapter_factory import SubmodelAdapterFactory

submodel_service_path = "/data/submodels"
file_system = SubmodelAdapterFactory.get_file_system(root_path=submodel_service_path)
```
